#  Landing Page Project

This is a beginner-level **Landing Page** built using **HTML** and **CSS** as part of my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The project focuses on the fundamental aspects of web design — layout, styling, and responsiveness — and showcases my understanding of frontend development basics.

##  Project Description

The goal of this project was to design a simple, clean, and visually appealing landing page layout that includes:
- Header and tagline
- Feature boxes/sections
- Footer
- Proper spacing, color palette, and alignment using CSS

This project helped me practice:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Using CSS for layout and design
- Flexbox for responsive section design
- Organizing project structure
